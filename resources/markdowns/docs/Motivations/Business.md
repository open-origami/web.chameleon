If you have read this far it is because you are a business manager and are interested in knowing what advantages Chameleon provides for your corporation. Throughout this section, we will give you some ideas on why you should use Chameleon.

Chameleon is a framework for the development of adaptive architectures based on components. The question that should be answered here is what advantages this kind of architectures offers to meet your business requirements. Without intending to be exhaustive here are some responses to this question.

### Personalization

Chameleon's dynamic transformation capabilities allow you to apply adaptive strategies in the User Interfaces of your products to meet your personalization needs. With an adaptive architecture, you can offer your clients a 1 to 1 experience with little effort since a personal configuration is often expressed only with a collection of elementary adaptive extensions.

### Analytics

Nowadays, knowing your customers is key to run your business. Discovering theirs habits, preferences, routines and needs will help you define a success strategy. However, acquiring this knowledge is not usually an easy task. Companies are realizing that the way users use the products is a valuable source of information. In this sense, Chameleon can become an effective ally. Building an easily extensible architecture that includes mechanisms for listening and monitoring user activity can be a starting point for your analytical strategy.

### Versioning

Getting a customer is complicated. Keeping her is even more difficult. That is why it is important to offer our users a continuous and seamless experience, where each updating and versioning process is not disruptive. Chameleon is an ideal solution to offer ever-green experiences. With each new release of features from your organization, you can send commands to your products that Chameleon will interpret as evolutionary transformation instructions that will take effect automatically and transparently.
